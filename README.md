As an Artisan who regularly develops CLI artisan commands; 
it is very essential to share the latest commands with the latest signatures and descriptions with the team.

## Installation

```bash
composer require chinmay/laravel-command-documentor
```

To generate documents for all the commands in the application, run the following command:

```bash
php artisan doc:generate
```

**Note:** This project is a work in progress (WIP).
